abstract = {For the generalized Fermi–Dirac integrals, Fk(η,β), of orders k=−1/2, 1/2, 3/2, and 5/2, we explicitly obtained the first 11 terms of their Sommerfeld expansions. The main terms of the last three orders are rewritten so as to avoid the cancelation problem. If η is not so small, say not less than 13.5, 12.0, 10.9, and 9.9 when k=−1/2, 1/2, 3/2, and 5/2, respectively, the first 8 terms of the expansion assure the single precision accuracy for arbitrary value of β. Similarly, the 15-digits accuracy is achieved by the 11 terms expansion if η is greater than 36.8, 31.6, 30.7, and 26.6 when k=−1/2, 1/2, 3/2, and 5/2, respectively. Since the truncated expansions are analytically given in a closed form, their computational time is sufficiently small, say at most 4.9 and 6.7 times that of the integrand evaluation for the 8- and 11-terms expansions, respectively. When η is larger than a certain threshold value as indicated, these appropriately-truncated Sommerfeld expansions provide a factor of 10–80 acceleration of the computation of the generalized Fermi–Dirac integrals when compared with the direct numerical quadrature.}

abstract = { We derive a relativistic Sommerfeld expansion for thermodynamic quantities in many-body fermionic systems. The expansion is used to generate the equation of state of the Walecka model and its isotherms. We find that these results are in good agreement with numerical calculations, even when the expansion is truncated at its lowest order, in the low temperature regime, defined by T/xf ≪ 1. Although the interesting region near the liquid-gas phase transition is excluded by this criterion, the expansion may still find usefulness in the study of very cold nuclear matter systems, such as neutron stars. }

The complete expansions of Fp(η) are then used to investigate the effect that these traditionally neglected exponentially small terms have on physical systems. It is shown that for a 2 dimensional nonrelativistic ideal Fermi gas, the subdominant exponentially small series becomes dominant.}",
